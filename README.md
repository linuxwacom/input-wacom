What is input-wacom?
--------------------
The Linux Wacom Project manages the drivers, libraries, and documentation for
configuring and running Wacom tablets under the Linux operating system. The
project consist of this driver (input-wacom),
[xf86-input-wacom](https://github.com/linuxwacom/xf86-input-wacom) and
[libwacom](https://github.com/linuxwacom/libwacom). Our drivers are
included in most major Linux distributions and provide out-of-the box support
for a wide variety of Wacom tablets and component devices.

Given this, you will only need this driver if you have a newer Wacom device,
are running an older operating system, or need a bugfix. If one of these situations
applies to you, 
[install input-wacom from source](https://github.com/linuxwacom/input-wacom/wiki/Installing-input-wacom-from-source)
by following the instructions in our wiki.
